# QSync

Capturing and Visualising Cryptocurrency Market Data.

Introducing QSync, a web application that gives users access to various visualisations of real-time and historical level-2 cryptocurrency data from across multiple
exchanges. This involves the bids and asks for a given asset, aggregated by price. The scalability of our data collection infrastructure allows for new currencies and exchanges to be integrated into the application with ease. QSync is highly performant, enabling traders to be first-movers on identifying profitable opportunities.

Some of our visualisations include a table of the best cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities in real-time, detailing the crypto to trade, the exchanges involved and the potential profit that can be made. With the rise in new cryptocurrency users, our visualisations also cater to the less-experienced trader. We provide explanations for key terminology, descriptions for supported crypto assets and information on how visualisations may be used in a particular trading strategy.
